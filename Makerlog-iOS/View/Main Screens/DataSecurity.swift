					2. If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you may request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
					3. If we no longer need your personal data, but you need them in order to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
					4. If you have lodged an objection in accordance with Art. 21 Paragraph 1 DSGVO, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests outweigh the interests of both parties, you have the right to demand that the processing of your personal data be restricted.
					If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data - apart from their storage - may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.
